            <p>I am Sarim Javed</p>
            <p>I am a BS IT student and  a strong background in Data Science and Machine Learning, specializing in model training, testing, and development for both production and prediction systems.
                 My work primarily focuses on building powerful deep learning models that drive intelligent insights and decision-making.</p>
            <p class="quote uppercase center"><span class="colorful-letter">Innovation unlocks</span>endless possibilities and turns challenges into opportunities.</p>

            <p>In addition to my expertise in AI, I also develop chatbots using Botpress, creating interactive and automated solutions. For the frontend, I work with HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript to build responsive Flask web applications that are both functional and user-friendly.
                Whether I'm training models to make accurate predictions or developing seamless web experiences, I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and make life easier.

        <section class="justify">
            <h2 class="main-title-large center">How it all started...</h2>
            <p>I was fascinated by how robots and AI can perform tasks that directly impact human life. This sparked my interest in chatbots, and I decided to learn how to create them for my own business. The potential of AI in medicine production and patient treatment also amazed me, which further fueled my passion for this field. Python, being a trending and versatile language, 
                became my go-to tool for many tasks, from database management to frontend development with Tkinter.</p>
            <p class="italic">AI Journey</p>
            <p>To showcase my AI models in real-time, I learned Flask to develop web applications, using JavaScript for server-side functionality. With my background in C, C++, Java, SQL, networking, and Linux, adapting to these new technologies was seamless. 
                This journey has been an exciting blend of leveraging my existing skills while embracing innovative ways to apply AI.
